# HYPECULTURE ðŸ‘Ÿ

**HYPECULTURE** is a command-line interface (CLI) application that simulates a complete marketplace for shoe reselling, built entirely with Python and MySQL. It's a "StockX" or "Amazon for shoes" built on a robust SQL backend, managing users, products, inventory, and orders from end to end.

This project was built as a comprehensive demonstration of database management principles, including relational schema design, SQL transactions, procedures, triggers (if added), and a multi-user application interface.
